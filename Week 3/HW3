1. Write a linear search algorithm both recursively and iteratively in pseudo code. Comment to explain.
    Linear:
        Take in an array and target, then loop through each element of the array
            Compare the current element of the array with the target
            If a match is found, return the index
        If the loop completes without finding the target, return None

    Recursive:
        Take in an array and target, optionally take in an index (defaults to 0 if not specified)
            Check the base case, look to see if the index is greater than or equal to the length of the array
                If so, return None
            Check to see if the current index is the target
                If so, return the index
            Return the recursive function with the index incremented by 1

2. Write the same linear search algorithms in the programming language of your choice. Comment to explain.

3. Rewrite the binary search algorithm from week 1 in a recursive form in pseudo code and in the programming language of your choice. Comment to explain.

4. Find a for loop you wrote in previous course work and rewrite it as a recursive function (it can not be a simple linear search problem). Please show the original code in your submission.
    

5. Use the following attached documents to test your search algorithms. numbers-3.txt Download numbers-3.txtUse one of your sorting algorithms to sort the list first before implementing binary search. What position is 8128705 in?   What position is 5842193?
